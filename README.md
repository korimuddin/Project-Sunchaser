Open &amp; Close - mobile app

main prompt used in kimik2:

Build a mobile app that integrates with the Google Maps API to display all nearby places that are currently open. The app should detect the user’s location and show shops, restaurants, cafés, attractions, movie theatres, museums, and other venue types, filtered by category using toggle buttons.

For each place shown, include the closing time and a live countdown timer displaying how long remains until closing. When a user selects a place, show its details alongside the countdown timer.

Key features required:
	•	Google Maps API integration
	•	Real-time “open now” status
	•	Live closing-time countdown timer for each venue
	•	Category toggles (e.g., restaurants, cafés, shops, movie theatres, museums, attractions)
	•	Map view + list view options
	•	User location detection
	•	Simple, modern UI

Build the app architecture, UI, and necessary API calls to support all features.
